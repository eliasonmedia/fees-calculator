# Handmade Fees Calculator

## Summary
At Goodsmiths, we share a goal with payment systems like Dwolla - we want to simplify and reduce the transaction fees our customers pay. We've both worked hard on this tool to allow anyone to easily understand how different fee systems compare.

This calculator factors in four types of fee: percentage commissions on the total price, flat transaction fees, listing fees, and monthly subscription fees. Handmade merchant platforms and payment gateways can have many different pricing models, so it may be wise to check the official sites of each company to confirm your results.

## Developers
This calculator was originally coded by Michael at Dwolla, then modified by Eric at Goodsmiths for the needs of the handmade community. The source code is freely available on Github.
