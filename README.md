# Payment System Fees Calculator

## Introduction
At Goodsmiths, we share a goal with payment systems like Dwolla - we want to simplify and reduce the transaction fees our customers pay. This calculator was originally coded by BaconSeason to allow anyone to easily understand how different payment system fees compare. The source code is freely available on Github.

## Disclaimer
Handmade merchant platforms and payment gateways have a lot of different pricing models, which means that the numbers could vary a little bit here and there. Bottom line: this tool is not 100% accurate, since you might qualify for some different pricing structure.
